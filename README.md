Frontend Web Developer Application
---
Thank you for applying for the position of Frontend Web developer at Motosumo.

We've forked this simple React.js showcase project, and we would like to add some features to demonstrate your skills in UX, UI or React. 

Here's what you need to do
---

- Fork this repository, and make it public so we can see the changes you make to it.
- Complete one or two of the following tasks, pick some that you feel showcases your strengths the best:
  - Style the calculator in a new and creative way
  - Implement a square root operator
  - Implement an undo functionality to bring you back to a previous state
  - Allow the user to select one of multiple themes that you implement.
  - Implement a _history_ functionality: You should be able to see previous calculation results, and select an old result to be able to use it in your continued calculations.
  - Allow the users to use the physical keyboard to do calculations
  - Add testing to the website (you decide what types of tests and how you want to do it)

Good luck!
